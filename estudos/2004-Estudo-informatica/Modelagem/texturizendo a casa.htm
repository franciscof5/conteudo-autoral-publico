STEP 1: I will talk about modelling etc in another tutorial. This one
is explaining skinning a simple building, the same principles could be
used on anything you make. This was the first time I tried this method
and it turned out OK so I will refine it over time I suppose. OK, build
your model and REGROUP it into useful groups. eg. front wall, back
wall, roof, sides, sign and step. to group something, select all the
faces you want in a group using SHIFT-LEFT CLICK to add to your
selection and SHIFT RIGHT CLICK to minus from your selection of faces,
then click regroup, rename it to something appropriate.<br><br><br>

<img src="texturizendo%20a%20casa_files/tshop2.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 2: Now hide everything, then unhide each group one at a time, each
time pressing PRINT SCREEN to screen grab it from the appropriate view,
I then cropped each view and composited them all onto a 1024x1024 blank
image in PS, laying them out as best I could and save it as shop.bmp or
something. I have added the names so its easy for you to see how I did
it. This will be resized down later, it just allows us to add more
detail.<br><br><br>


<img src="texturizendo%20a%20casa_files/tshop3.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 3: Now create a new Material and choose your map from the dialog,
shop.bmp we created earlier and assign it to all the groups. Now select
one group at a time and open the "Texture Coordinate Editor" and align
each group over map. As shown, I have scaled and aligned the front of
the mesh over the front part in the texture map. Choose your group from
the pulldown, choose the viewpoint from the pulldown below, then remap,
now use scale and move to position each group. Once you have aligned
them all you should see something like the image below.<br><br><br>

<img src="texturizendo%20a%20casa_files/tshop4.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 4: As you can see the shop.bmp is mapped all over the model and
the texture matches what the mesh looks like underneath (more or less)
heh heh, now it is simply a case of actually painting the shop.bmp to
suit the model. Want a different building?? paint a new skin using the
shop.bmp as a template then load that map up as the texture.<br><br><br>


<img src="texturizendo%20a%20casa_files/tshop5.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 5: You can see the shop.bmp loaded into the texture slot, this is
then assigned to all your groups which are using your texture
coordinates that you set when you aligned each group over the template.
You MUST click new in the material dialog before you can load in your
bitmap. Also it helps to rename it, but I forgot this time, heh heh
very naughty!!!<br><br><br>


<img src="texturizendo%20a%20casa_files/tshop6.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 6: A bit more progress. I like to paint over the template on
layers above the template in my paint package so I can hide em and
check alignment and stuff. Also if you make changes to the shop.bmp or
whatever your skin is called :) you must reload the shop.bmp in
milkshape before it refreshes and sometimes you have to click on the
model as well. This is useful for checking your progress. <br><br><br>


<img src="texturizendo%20a%20casa_files/tshop7.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 7: This is the completed skin. Its easy enough to see where
everything is and you can paint other skins and map em onto the same
model for variations.<br><br><br>

STEP 8: Heres a couple of examples. I hope you found this tutorial
useful, If you did drop by the forums or email me so I know if its
worth me writing any more.....<br><br><br>
