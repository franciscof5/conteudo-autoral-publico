<font size="6">Unwrapping a Bipedal Character</font>
<br>by Joseph Hocking
<br>see his <a href="http://www.3darteest.com/">artwork</a><br><br><br>
This tutorial will explain how the tools in Ultimate Unwrap3D can be
used to quickly and effectively unwrap a bipedal character model.</font><p>
<font face="arial">Note that the terms "UV coordinates" and "texture
coordinates" mean the same thing (the UV vertex and edge information
that determines where various parts of the texture image appear on the
model,) and "unwrapping" and "texture mapping" both refer to the
process of assigning these coordinates. Analogous terms are used pretty
much at random below.</font></p><p>

<font face="arial">Here's a picture of the model used in this tutorial:</font></p><p>
<font face="arial"><img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char1.png" name="tut_char1.png" border="0" height="380" width="349"></font></p><p>

<font face="arial">The entire model will be mapped onto one texture using Ultimate Unwrap3D.</font></p><p>

<font face="arial">We will begin with the head, a relatively standard place to start when texture mapping a humanoid character.<br>
<br>
<br>
</font></p><h2><font face="arial">The Head</font></h2>
<font face="arial">Select the polygons of the head. Now apply a
Cylindrical mapping (by clicking the "Cylindrical Map" button or under
the "Tools" menu;) for humans, the head approximates a cylinder (except
for specific features like the ears.) Note that you will need to set
the mapping to the appropriate axis in the box that pops up. In all
likelihood, you will want the Y axis; this achieves a mapping that
wraps around a vertical cylinder:<br>
<br>
<img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char2.png" name="tut_char3.png" border="0" height="229" width="229"><br>
<br>
More often than not, the head will not be unwrapped correctly the first
try due to the placement of the seam. In a cylindrical mapping, the UVs
must be split vertically in order to lay them out flat. A seam results
where this split occurs. While you should strive to minimize and/or
completely camoflage such seams when you create the texture image, it
will be helpful for the seam to be placed in a relatively unimportant
place. In this case, the default cylindrical mapping placed the seam (a
VERY important place) whereas a better place for the seam would be the
back of the head (less important.)</font><p>
<font face="arial">To control the placement of the seam, adjust the "Seam Rotation" parameter in the box that pops up when you apply the mapping:
<br>
<br>
<img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char3.png" name="tut_char3.png" border="0" height="374" width="279"><br>
<br>
<br>
A little trial and error is necessary here, as you must reapply the
cylindrical mapping several times, making incremental adjustments to
"Seam Rotation" each time until the head is unwrapped correctly. In
this case, I found that 90 degrees placed the seam correctly:<br>
<br>
<img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char4.png" name="tut_char4.png" border="0" height="233" width="229"><br>
<br>
One other note about cylindrical mapping is that, for many models,
there won't be any obvious surface features to help you determine where
the seam is being placed. In that case, you will need to apply a
temporary texture to the model so that you can see the seam. Simply
create a new material, assign a non-tileable image as the material's
diffuse map, and (having selected the entire model) assign the material
by right-clicking on it in the "Scene" window.
</font></p><p>
<font face="arial">While it wasn't strictly necessary in this case,
here is a temporary texture applied to the model in order to highlight
the seam:<br>
<br>

<img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char5.png" name="tut_char5.png" border="0" height="380" width="349"><br>
<br>
Finally, with the head texture mapped, you should move those UVs out of
the square so that they'll be out of the way as you work on the rest of
the body:<br>
<br>
<img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char6.png" name="tut_char6.png" border="0" height="130" width="213"><br>
<br><br>

<br>
</font></p><h2><font face="arial">Torso</font></h2>

<font face="arial">Whereas the head was mapped as a cylinder, the torso is generally best mapped as two planes, front and back.<br>
<br>
Select all the polygons on the front half of the torso, and hit the
"One Sided Planar Map" button. In the window that pops up, make sure to
choose the axis perpendicular to the desired plane (in this case the X
axis:)<br>
<br>
<img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char7.png" name="tut_char7.png" border="0" height="202" width="204"><br>
<br>
As with the head, move the UVs out of the working space. Now select all
the polygons of the back half, set another planar map, and move those
UVs aside as well.<br>
<br>

<br>
</font><h2><font face="arial">Limbs</font></h2>
<font face="arial">The limbs ie. arms and legs are basically cylinders,
so cylindrical mapping is the obvious approach. Select the polygons in
one arm (make sure NOT to select any part of the hand as the hand is
not part of the cylinder,) and apply cylindrical mapping. As with the
head, use the "Seam Rotation" parameter to move the mapping seam to a
relatively unimportant place such as the side facing the body:<br>
<br>
<img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char8.png" name="tut_char8.png" border="0" height="380" width="349"></font><p>
<font face="arial">As pointed out, the ends of the arms and legs ie.
the hands and feet are not cylindrical as with the rest of their
respective limbs. Map the hands and feet with planar mappings like the
torso.
<br><br><br>Note that for most characters the limbs are symmetrical.
That is, the arm and leg on one side of the body are mirror images of
the arm and leg on the other side of the body. Thus, if both the
geometry and texture is/will be identical on both sides of the body,
you can save space on the texture image by mapping only the limbs on
one side of the body and mirroring them across to form the other side.<br>
<br>
To mirror an arm across the body, first delete the other arm; select
all the polygons of the other arm, then select "Delete" under the
"Edit" menu. Now select the polygons of the arm to be copied.
Right-click in the Preview window and select "Mirror" under "Faces." In
the window that pops up, choose the appropriate axis to mirror across,
increase "Spacing" so that the mirrored arm won't overlap the body, and
make sure "Mirror Copy" is checked so that the original arm being
mirrored will remain:</font></p><p>
<font face="arial"><img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char9.png" name="tut_char9.png" border="0" height="380" width="349"></font></p><p>

<font face="arial">Now that a mirrored arm has been created, select the
polygons in the new arm and, using "Move" under "Faces" when you
right-click in the Preview window, move the new arm into place.
Finally, select "Weld Model" under "Tools" to fuse the new arm onto the
model. That the fusing happened correctly can be verified by setting
the Preview window to "Smooth Shaded;" there should not be a visible
seam where the arm joins the body. If a seam is apparent, you must move
the new arm some more so that it fits exactly (ie. the vertices at the
end of the arm overlap the vertices of the hole in the body,) and then
weld the model again. You will probably also need to increase the
"Tolerance" value in the window that pops up; I generally use 0.01.<br>

<br>
<br>
</font></p><h2><font face="arial">Texture Tetris</font></h2>
<font face="arial">Once all the parts of the body have been unwrapped
you must make all the texture coordinates fit in the grey square. If
you've been doing it correctly, all the UVs are outside of the grey
square, out of the working space. This square represents the dimensions
of the texture image, so now you must put them back into the square in
order for the texture image to be applied correctly to the model.<br>
<br>
However, there are a couple caveats. One, when moving UVs back into the
square, you must make sure none overlap (each part of the model needs
its own unique part of the texture image.) Two, you must make sure as
much of the square is used as possible.</font><p>
<font face="arial">Thus, a Tetris game results as you attempt, by
scaling, rotating, and moving the UVs, to pack all the various shapes
as tightly as possible. Here is an example of the UV coordinates after
going through this process:</font></p><p>
<font face="arial"><img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char10.png" name="tut_char10.png" border="0" height="209" width="202"><br>
<br>
<br>
</font></p><h2><font face="arial">Cleanup</font></h2>
<font face="arial">At this point the texture mapping is almost done.
However, there is probably warping and stretching in the texture
coordinates and you'll want to root out such errors before painting a
texture.</font><p>

<font face="arial">Assign a material to the model (if you have not
already done so,) and set the material's Diffuse Map to Checker. You'll
probably want to increase the tiling of the checkered map (I use 20 by
20) in order to make the checkered squares small enough to be effective.</font></p><p>

<font face="arial">Anywhere the checkers don't appear square (stretched
out to a rectangle, etc.) there is an error you should correct.
Correcting errors generally requires moving vertices around in the main
editor window (make sure to switch to "Select by Vertex.") For example,
the planar mappings applied to the torso usually result in stretching
on the sides of the body:</font></p><p>
<font face="arial"><img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char11.png" name="tut_char11.png" border="0" height="380" width="349"></font></p><p>

<font face="arial">To correct this, you must select the vertices along
the side of the torso and move them out to apportion more space on the
texture image. Other errors are corrected in a similar manner; select
vertices around the error and move those vertices to adjust the mapping.</font></p><p>

<font face="arial">Once you have corrected all the errors, the checkered pattern on the model will look even and uniform:</font></p><p>
<font face="arial"><img src="tutorial_char_files/tut_char12.png" name="tut_char12.png" border="0" height="380" width="349"></font></p><p>

<font face="arial">Now you're done unwrapping the model.  Export the UV map and you're ready to start painting the texture.<br>
<br>
<br>
As you can see, unwrapping a character model using Ultimate Unwrap3D is
pretty easy. And of course, these techniques apply readily to other
sorts of models too.<br>
