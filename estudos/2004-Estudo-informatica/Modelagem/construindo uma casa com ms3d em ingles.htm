STEP 1: First off I drew a 3d sketch on paper of how I wanted the house
to look, I find it much easier to work from reference pics or at least
a sketch, it gives you good idea of what you need to do even before you
start. Anyway, using the VERTEX creation button as shown I plotted the
shape of my house from the side.<br><br><br>

<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse2.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 2: Now using the FACE tool as shown, create a face by clicking 3
points ANTICLOCKWISE, this creates a face with the normals facing you.
you should see a grey triangle on your 3d view, if its black select the
face and go to the menu up top and FACE-REVERSE VERTEX ORDER this faces
it opposite to whichever way that face was facing :) if you create your
face right you wont need this but occasionally you get a rogue face
that needs flipping..<br><br><br>


<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse3.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 3: Now do the same for the other faces, watching your 3d view
build up until you have a side of the house. Easy enough? I also moved
my vertex's at this point to straighten out my wonky edges :).<br><br><br>

<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse4.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 4: Now go to the top menu and click EDIT-DUPLICATE SELECTION or
just press CTRL-D. deselect the Y and Z so just X is selected(as
shown), now when you move the duplicate it will slide over staying
exactly in line with the other side. It will also be facing the same
way, so while the new side is still selected, go and reverse the vertex
order, this will flip it to face outwards on the other end of the
house! The black faces should all be facing inwards.....<br><br>


<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse5.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 5: Time to build some doors and windows. Ok, now create 4 vertexs'
on the imaginary front of the house and create 4 more just inside as
shown. This so we can inset the door, now create all the faces as shown
in the next pic......<br><br><br>


<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse6.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 6: After creating the faces select the inner 4 vertex's and in the
side view move them back a bit, as you can see in the 3d view we now
have an inset where the door will be. <br><br><br>


<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse7.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 7: DO the same type of thing for a window, then DUPLICATE em and
scale em for the other windows, moving them into place making sure they
line up in each of the views.I made some for the back by duplicating
the top front ones and using VERTEX- MIRROR/FRONT to BACK to flip em
then moved them into position.<br><br><br>



<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse8.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 8: Now we create the front wall. 1...2...3 create the faces for
the lower front wall, the upper front wall and the back wall (CHANGE
the front view to back view for this) ALSO MY BIGGEST AND MOST USEFUL
TIP EVER: select all the vertexs you wont be needing and hide em using
CTRL-H. AS you can see while I was working on the front faces all the
back vertexes have been hidden, this saves you constantly trying to
select vertexs and getting it wrong..<br><br><br>



<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse9.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 9: Again, hide all the front vertex's and even the inner window
ones as pointed out, using CTRL H to hide all selected stuff. This
helps a lot :) USE unhide all or CTRL U to unhide all the vertex's. I
haven't bothered about the roof faces because we will be making the
roof's from boxes in the next step.<br><br><br>



<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse10.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 10: For the lower roof I created a box, scaled it, rotated it, and
moved it into place. The top roof was done the same way, I built one
half and moved the vertex's at the top point so they will meet the
other side of the roof. DUPLICATE and MIRROR-FRONT 2 BACK. Now I
selected each pair of vertexs that were almost touching, used SNAP
TOGETHER the WELD TOGETHER to join the top edges.<br><br><br>


<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse11.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 11: I kept the roof quite seperate from the rest, it just made it
easier to work on and select. Now we can create groups ready for
mapping. I selected all the side faces as shown. Use SHIFT-LEFT CLICK
to add faces to your selection and SHIFT-RIGHT CLICK to remove faces
from your selection. Once all the side faces are selected go to groups
and click regroup, then reneam it to "sides" or something.I created
several groups:- Sides, front, back, lower roof, upper roof this makes
it easier to map as shown in my mapping tutorial. Go check that out
next!!!!!<br><br><br>



<img src="construindo%20uma%20casa%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/thouse12.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 12: A few different views for ya. As you can see its not that hard
and these same techniques can be used to build anything you want. This
building is only 149 Triangles which is nothing!!! and with texture
mapping it will look pretty good in any game engine. I hope you found
this tutorial useful, if you do drop by my forums in the 3DIMENSIONAL
section for a chat or explanations etc. CYA's<br><br><br>
