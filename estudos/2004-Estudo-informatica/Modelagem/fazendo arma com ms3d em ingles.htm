STEP 1: First thing I do is Right click in the Left view and click
"Choose background image" and find the image I will be working from. I
am going to build the middle part of the gun first so I add a load of
vertexs' around the outline and in key places, then I start building up
the faces as shown in the next step.<br><br><br>

<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun2.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 2: Now using the FACE tool as shown, create a face by clicking 3
points ANTICLOCKWISE, this creates a face with the normals facing you.
you should see a grey triangle on your 3d view, if its black select the
face and go to the menu up top and FACE-REVERSE VERTEX ORDER this faces
it opposite to whichever way that face was facing :) if you create your
face right you wont need this but occasionally you get a rogue face
that needs flipping. I carry on until I have a solid plane the same
shape as the guns middle section.<br><br><br>


<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun3.jpg" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun4.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 3: As I was building the faces on the grip I wasn't watching the
3d view and built them all the wrong way :) so now I select all the
affected faces and go to Face/Reverse Vertex Order to flip em over to
face the right way. Sorted.<br><br><br>

<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun5.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 4: Now I selected all the faces and clicked extrude, now in the
Front or Top view, I dragged the faces across to create the depth. As
you can see there is an open side now (black) which has no faces so we
need fill em in, now we could do it by hand, but theres a quicker way.<br><br>


<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun6.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 5: We select all the side-on faces again and Duplicate it, move it
across with "X" restraining so it moves across but not up or down. The
whole side will still be facing the wrong way so go to Face/Reverse
Vertex Order to flip it so the grey faces are facing outwards as shown.
To ADD to your selection of faces use SHIFT Left Click and to minus
from your selection use SHIFT Right Click.<br><br><br>


<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun7.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 6: Now move the new side in and as close to the other vertexs' so
it looks like its joined. Now Select all the vertexs' on that side in
the Front or Top view and go to Vertex/Weld Together this should weld
them all together, now we have a solid middle section. <br><br><br>


<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun8.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 7: Now I started building some of the other parts by creating a
boxes and scaling em to size. Also I intend to create the scope and
front grip/barrel from cylinders 1 Stack high and 8 slices(sides).<br><br><br>



<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun9.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 8: To add detail I selected all the vertexs' in the Clip and
scaled them inwards in the Front or Top view as shown, this makes it
slightly thinner than the rest of the gun.<br><br><br>



<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun10.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 9: I added a couple of cylinders for the Front Grip and Scope.
Also I selected the vertexs' on one end of the scope and rotated them
slightly as shown to match the picture.<br><br><br>



<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun11.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 10: I created a cylinder for the barrel then selected just the end
faces by selecting them in the Front View, which also selected a load
of others in the model, which I deselected in the Top view using
SHIFT-Right Click and dragged selections over them until only the front
of the barrel was selected. Then I clicked Extrude and in the Right
View I dragged the barrel out twice and then scaled up that end part in
the Front view.<br><br><br>


<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun12.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 11: I grouped the model into 3 groups, the Scope ends, the Barrel
end and the rest of the gun. Now I created a NEW material(1), clicked
the box for the map(2) and opened the map I created then selected all
the groups and Assigned(3) the material to them all, as you can see the
mapping is very wrong :)<br><br><br>



<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun13.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 12: Now select just the main Gun group and open up the texture
coordinate editor. Select Gun(1) then Left View(2) then remap(3) and
you will see the gun faces from the side view. I scaled it down and
moved it into position over the map of the side of the gun as shown.
Now do the same for the Scope and Barrel but choose Front View before
remapping. You may have to close the TCE(texture coordinate editor) and
select each group one at a time. Cant remember now :)<br><br><br>


<img src="fazendo%20arma%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/tmgun14.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 13: As you can see I selected the Scope End group, aligned it over
the the Red circle in the Texture coordinate editer and you get a red
lens on each end of the Scope. I did the same with the hole in the
barrel end.<br><br><br>

STEP 14: A few renders with an old Free version of truespace, Its about
400 polys' which is quite acceptable I think, but with a bit more
thought it could be reduced considerably. I hope you found this
tutorial useful, if you did drop by my forums in the 3DIMENSIONAL
section for a chat or any questions you might have or to show off your
models, I'd love to see em!!!! CYA's<br><br><br>
