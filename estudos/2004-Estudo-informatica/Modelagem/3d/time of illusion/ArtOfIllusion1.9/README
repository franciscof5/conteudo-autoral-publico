Art of Illusion v1.8Copyright 1999-2004 by Peter Eastman1. IntroductionArt of Illusion is a free, open source 3D graphics studio.  It combinesmodelling, texturing, animation, and rendering in one application, withadvanced features which compare favorably to those found in many commercialprograms.Art of Illusion is written entirely in Java.  It should (in theory) workunder any Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which is compatible with Sun's JavaDevelopment Kit (JDK) 1.4 or later.  Instructions on how to run theprogram under various operating systems, as well as the complete sourcecode, can be found at:http://www.artofillusion.org2.
