STEP 1: I got a skin from my m8 Gusher from the Prefablab, and created
a front, side and top view from it, I then right clicked in each view
in milkshape and clicked "Choose background" for each window giving me
refernence to work from, all the pics are the same scale as well, then
using the vertex button I began building points around the edges and
basically anywhere that faces will change direction, ie corners and
wheelarches etc.<br><br><br>

<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut2.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 2: Now I basically block in the whole side by building it triangle
by triangle, thinking about them carefully as well, so that the shape
of the arches etc can be formed correctly, make sure all tri's are
facing the same way. ie grey, if not, select it/them and reverse the
vertex order from the face menu, this will face them in the opposite
direction and its best to do it as you go along instead of getting
further in and finding holes all over the place.<br><br><br>


<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut3.jpg" border="0"><br>
STEP 3: As you can see I have now created the whole solid side of the
car, checking in the 3d view shows all the faces are facing the correct
way.
<br><br><br>

<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut4.jpg" border="0"><br>STEP
4: Now select all the faces, click on the extrude tool and deselect Y
and Z restricting extrude to the X direction, Now in the front view
drag/extrude the faces across to give the model its depth. The inner
faces are not filled, and thats OK because will be flipping this side
once its done to create the other side :)<br><br><br>


<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut5.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 5: Now I start to select vertices and move them in/out etc to form
the shape of the arches, and curves of the car, no way I can explain
all this really, just takes lots of time. I also hide all the vertces I
dont want to get confused by, ie the vertices along the centre seam so
I can work on the outer body without affecting other vertices etc. I
use it a lot, CTLR H to hide and CTRL U to unhide all, very useful!!!!!<br><br><br>


<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut6.jpg" border="0"> <br>
STEP 6: This pic is wrong I figured out later, damn, Miss out step 1 :)
I selected triangles as shown the clicked on a smoothing groups number
this created a group of faces that are all smoothed seperately from the
others, this is how I defined the sharp edges of the arches and skirts.
Make sense heh heh? I was actually regrouping them at first then I
realised that I didn't need to :)<br><br><br>


<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut7.gif" border="0"> <br>
STEP 7: OK, now after many hours of pushing asnd pulling vertices about
I duplicated all the faces, the duplicate is in eactly the same place
as the original so you see nothing, now click on vertex, and mirror
Left&lt;-&gt;Right and you now have 2 sides, woohoo!!! Now select all
the centre seam vertices and click weld together, then select all faces
and Regroup it into one mesh .<br><br><br>

<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut8.gif" border="0"> <br>
STEP 8: I actually built the wheel in GMAX and gave it cylindrical
mapping then imported it into here, above you can see the wheel that I
broke into tread and sides groups, mapped it and aligned it over the
texture map, then regrouped em, you see the slignment above..duplicate
em for the other wheels and mirror them for the other side, material
must be assigned to each new duplicate.<br><br><br>

<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut9.gif" border="0"> <br>
STEP 9: Now comes another long part, I selected all the triangles that
make up the sides, regrouped em, aligned over the texture map, and then
did the same for the front, back, top, underside, interior, steering
wheel and seats. Once I was sure that was all done I regrouped it all
into a solid mesh.<br><br><br>


<img src="Audi%20com%20ms3d%20em%20ingles_files/atut10.gif" border="0"> <br>
STEP 10: Here you can see the whole mesh once regrouped laid out over
the texture map phew, thats it, easy wasn't it. My advice would be to
start off simple and learn the texhniques, it also gives you an idea
how long all this stuff bloody takes :) then take on bigger and badder
projects, any questions, drop by the forums and ask away!<br><br><br>

a pic of the model from a few angles. I hope you found this tutorial
useful, If you did drop by the forums so I know if its worth me writing
these things.<br><br><br>
