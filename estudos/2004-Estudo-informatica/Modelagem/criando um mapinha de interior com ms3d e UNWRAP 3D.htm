</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CREATE SOME VERTEXS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">IN MILKSHAPE I
created some vertexs and used CTRL G after creating everyone to snap em
to the grid keeping stuff square. Note I'm working in the TOP view,
this will give correct export to the B3D format. Another thing is you
could scan a sketch or plan and use it as a background to model from,
just a thought :)
<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int02.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CREATE SOME FACES</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now I fill in the
vertexs by building faces 1,2,3 as in my other tutorials, and I end up
with a solid flat shape resembling the plan view of the rooms.<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int03.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Extruding</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Select all the faces
then Extrude upwards (unchecking X,Z to stop sideways movement) you now
have some depth but it has no floor, leave the ceiling selected and go
to the next step. BUT before you do note the orientation of the level,
I'll make an image soon showing how to orient stuff so it imports
correctly into Blitz Basic 3D.<br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int04.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DUPLICATE AND SNAP 'N' WELD</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Use CTRL D to create
a Duplicate, VERTEX MIRROR TOP-&gt;BOTTOM to flip it, then MOVE it down
to line up with the bottom of the walls as shown. Now Select ALL and
regroup, hide all the verts in the tops of the walls in that side view
by selecting em and using CTRL H. Now in the top view go around all the
verts arounf the floor and walls one by one, snapping and welding, CTRL
N then CTRL W. This joins it all together nicely, unhide all with CTRL
U.<br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int05.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REVERSE VERTEXS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So now I have a
solid set of rooms but all the faces are facing outward, so select all
FACES and click FACE-&gt;REVERSE VERTEX ORDER to flip all faces inside
out, you also need to right click in the 3D window and uncheck DRAW
BACKFACES, now as you rotate around you will see only faces that are
facing towards you, and faces that face away are invisible, woohoo! I
now have an interior :) <br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int06.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">REGROUPING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this side view
select ALL then use SHIFT-RIGHT CLICK DRAG to drag a box over the walls
and the floor, leaving only the ceiling selected, regroup and rename to
CEILING as shown, now hide it, do the same for the floor,
select/regroup/rename/hide and the same for the walls, I now have 3
seperate objects, WALLS, CEILING, FLOOR! CTRL U unhide all :)<br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int07.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UNWRAP 3D</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Save in MILKSHAPE,
then open in UNWRAP 3D, this is where I'm gonna texture map it! So
right click on FLOOR to bring up the menu, check AUTOHIDE and
rightclick again to bring it up again and click SELECT, as you can see
the floor is selected, I will just refer to this as select FLOOR, or
select WALL from now on.<br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int08.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PLANAR MAPPING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Basically for the
floor I want one sided PLANAR mapping, so click
TOOLS&gt;UVMAPPING&gt;PLANAR&gt;ONESIDED and choose y-TOP and apply it,
as you can see I get a top view in the UV mappin space, Use
EDIT&gt;SCALE&gt;CORNER FREE (I assigned it to "S" for quick use) and
scale it to fill the square. The floor is now getting the whole image
mapped onto it....WHAT IMAGE? see next......<br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int09.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SIMPLE TEXTURE</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I made a simple
256x256 texture with a gradient and a white strip just to illustrate
how the mapping looks in the next few steps.<br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int10.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MATERIAL</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I added a new
material and chose BITMAP and found my gradient image, I then selected
the FLOOR and right clicked on the gradient material in the righthand
sidebar and chose ASSIGN, as you can see the floor now has this texture
stretched over the whole floor!!!! the next step shows how to TILE it.<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int11.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TILING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now I selected the
FLOOR again, and clicked EDIT&gt;SCALE&gt;ARBITRARY and I get the
options box pop up as shown. A lot of people dont realise that if you
scale the UV's larger than the projection square you get Tiling as
shown, X2 gives twice as big, press it a couple more times and apply, I
now have this UV mapping tiled over the FLOOR, I'll change the texture
later...<br><br><br>



<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int12.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE CEILING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MAKE sure you have
already rightclicked the preview window and UNchecked SHOW&gt;SOLID
BACKFACES. I moved down below so the floor disappears and the ceiling
is Visible, click CEILING in the righthand sidebar and assign the
texture to it, I used EDIT&gt;SCALE&gt;ARBITRARY again to tile it like
the FLOOR.<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int13.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OK NOW THE HARD PART</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Select the WALLS,
Assign the texture to em, and click TOOLS&gt;UV MAPPING&gt;FACE as
shown, the next step shows the details......<br><br><br>

<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int14.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FACE MAPPING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Set it to SEPERATE
BY NORMAL, DEGREES=1 (experiment with this :)), OVERLAPPING and you
should see something like the above, all the wall faces are mapped in a
line over the top of each other....
<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int15.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCALE em UP</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now CORNERFREESCALE
em up to fit the whole UV space/texture map and as you can see all the
walls in the 3D preview have the texture running around em! The heights
OK, but the width is getting stretched along the long walls, see next
step for horizontal tiling.....<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int16.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">HORIZONTAL TILING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">click SCALE
ARBITRARY again and set U=2(horizontal) and V=1(vertical) and apply and
you can see it is twice as wide but the height has stayed the same, we
now have tiling, check the next step for a close up after APPLYING it a
few more times!!!!<br><br><br>

<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int17.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE TILING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This texture doesn't
show it that well but you can see the tiling on the walls, follow the
red lines :) Now I can look at ASSIGNING some new textures.<br><br><br>

<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int18.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MORE TEXTURES</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I made a simple
checker to show this point. Click WALLS (so it knows what your trying
to select) and CLICK the 3d preview window to make sure its ACTIVE, now
press "S" to toggle FACE SELECTION MODE, using SHIFT to add to face
selections and CTRL to remove from slections. I SELECTED some faces as
shown and assigned a check to em just to show you how it works really!<br><br><br>

<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int19.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PROPER TEXTURES</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OK, I added a couple
of new materials and chose wall.jpg and floor.jpg, I right click WALLS
and clicked SELECT to select all the walls, I assigned the wall
texture, I then did the same for the floor with the FLOOR texture, as
you can see its starting to look like something :) Its a good time now
to have a good look over the model to se if all the mapping is OK, if
its wrong, press "S" select the faces and UV map with planar...this bit
is hard to explain but you'll figure it out :)<br><br><br>

<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int20.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASSIGNING AGAIN</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now I added a few
other materials and I can select walls/floors,ceiling FACES, assign
textures easily. This is a simple model but the idea could be used on
far more complex geometry, building a level in stages and joining it
together in Milkshape later, adding scenery elements made seperately,
dummy OBJECTS that you search and replace in BLITZ BASIC 3D (or
whatever you use) for lights,doors, enemies, effects etc etc...........<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int23.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UPSIDE DOWN UV's</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sometimes you get
UV's that are upside down, press "S" to select the faces, then click
FLIP VERTICALLY as shown, check the next step to see it flipped......<br><br><br>

<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int24.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FLIPPED</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you can see its
flipped to match the others around it (if thats what you want) you can
also flip horizontally, rotate, scale, move etc!!!! This allows quite a
bit of tweaking and variations.<br><br><br>






<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int21.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">INSIDE</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I switched on SHOW
SOLID FACES again and zoomed inside it and I can move around inside to
check how it looks while still in UNWRAP 3D!!!!! Save it Often as well
as you go through just in case!!!! :)<br><br><br>


<img src="criando%20um%20mapinha%20de%20interior%20com%20ms3d%20e%20UNWRAP%203D_files/int22.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FINISHED</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOLID FACES are
still on but I right clicked in the 3d view and clicked HIDE&gt;CEILING
so it doesn't block the view and heres the finished simple level!!!!!!
Also pressing "V" toggles between normal shading and Vertex shading
which is usally brighter! SAVE it and you can open it up in Milkshape
and export to B3D format (if thats what your using) Hope you guys found
this useful, as I learn more I'll write more :) Cya's<br>Psionic<br><br>
