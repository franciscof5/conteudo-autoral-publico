<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To start with I
selected all the faces in the Head (please read my other tuts for tips
on how to select things) Then I pressed REGROUP and re-named the new
group HEAD as you can see, now Click HIDE because we dont want that bit
in the way. I then did the same for the rest of the model, front torso,
back torso, legs front, legs back, left arm, right arm etc. Selecting

</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">GROUPS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have applied some colours just to demonstrate how the groups I have broken it down into look.<br><br><br>


<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm03.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MORE GROUPS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I check it in all
views in Wireframe and Flat to make sure all the groups are correct and
we are now ready to open up Lithunwrap which you used to be able to get
for FREE from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/lithunwrap"><u>LithUnwrap</u></a>. IT HAS NOW MOVED AND BEEN RENAMED TO UNWRAP3D and a demo can be found at  <a href="http://www.unwrap3d.com/"><u>Unwrap 3D</u></a>
and it can be purchased for $29 (or about 20 quid here in the UK) the
program hasn't changed that much so this tutorial is still pretty
relevent :)<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm04.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LITHUNWRAP</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now its time to open
up Lithunwrap, then go to File&gt;model&gt;open and open your uv.ms3d
model up in here, and basically you get a blank screen with a little
square in the top left corner..Cool! OK on the right side click the
cross by Groups and it will expand to show all your groups as above no
RIGHT CLICK ON materials and click ADD from the menu, we are going to
add a simple checked pattern so we can see any stretching of the UV's
on the model and hopefully try and fix em.<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm05.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADDING A MATERIAL</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stage 1, rename the
material to "check" then Double-Click to bring up the properties Menu,
Stage 2, Click the maps TAB, Stage 3, Click the Map type and select
checker (This is also where you would select Bitmap and load a bitmap
as a texture) but for now we need a checker. Stage 4, Click the
properties and the map properties menu pops up, in the next pic we will
change the colours of the check and the tiling.....<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm06.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SETTING COLOUR AND TILING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stage 1, Click
colour one and choose a light blue, Stage 2, click colour 2 and pick a
dark blue, I dont use black and white cus it makes my eyes hurt :) Just
a personal preference plus the vertexs/faces dont show up on the white
parts!!!!. Stage 3, after choosing the colours set the tiling to 8 (or
16 sometimes) this gives plenty of checks to help show up bad mapping
later on....NOW click OK and click material once, then Click Check
again and it should appear filling the screen!<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm07.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASSIGN THE TEXTURE</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stage 1, Click edit,
Stage 2, Click Unhide all, this will as it says unhide all the faces,
but because theres no UV's yet its all still bunched up in the corner,
Stage 3 is to select the Faces button as shown, Textures can only be
assigned to faces (or groups I think) and NOT vertices
obviously.....Check out the next step to see how to assign the check to
the model..<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm08.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ACTUALLY ASSIGNING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click Select in the
menu and "Select All" this selects all the faces in your model that you
unhided (is that a word? :)) in the previous step. Now RIGHT CLICK on
the check material to bring up the menu, and Stage 2, Select ASSIGN,
this will assign the current material to all the faces (or groups)
selected. As you can see in the preview window he has gone blue, he
still hasn't got any UV mapping yet tho' were getting to that very
soon....<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm09.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">APPLY DECAL MAPPING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stage 1, Right Click
"torso front" and click "Select" in the popup menu, this selects the
group you want to apply mapping to. Stage 2, Click Tools&gt;UV
Mapping&gt;Decal for simple flat planar mapping onto a simple-ish
flat-ish surface, the front of the torso. Stage 3, click the button
Z-front because we want it projected from the front onto the torso,
Click OK and as you can see he now has some checks on the torso.<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm10.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FIXING STRETCHING....</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PLEASE read the
picture right to left on this one, sorry its just the way I did it :)
As you can see in Stage one theres a bit of stretching on the tops of
the shoulders, to fix it in Stage 2, I select the four vertexs
(Changing to vertexs mode by clicking the vertex button to the left of
the faces button I pointed out earlier) then in Stage 3, I dragged them
upwards to expose the faces to the Front projected mapping, I'll try
and explain in the next diagram!!!!<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm11.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOME THEORY</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OK, I'll try to
explain why planar/decal mapping stretches or smears. In the first
image above left imagine looking down on some faces that are curving
away from where the mapping is being projected from. The faces that are
at an angle only get a small portion of the mapping thats being aimed
at it. In the second image above right, you have to imagine keeping the
angled away faces the same length but rotating(or moving) them forward
to face the oncoming image, you do this by moving the vertexs in vertex
mode, I will try and show some more examples as they arise. Its
basically like reverse origami :)))) you have to unfold things so they
are flat and facing forwards, then when they are wrapped around the
shape of the model you get stretch free mapping.....most of the time!
My advice is start on something much simpler than this model....<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm12.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE BACK</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here I selected the
back group (if you right click on it in the right hand list you will
see that in the menu AUTOHIDE is clicked, this hides all the other
groups allowing you to work on just one at a time) I applied DECAL
mapping again but chose "BACK" as the direction this time. The red
areas I have highlighted, were very close because they were facing
almost side on to the projection, so I selected all the vertexs and
dragged them outwards so the faces are facing the oncoming
image....well they will be when we get there :) SAVE your model as you
go along as well, and choose MS3D format as well. ALSO worth mentioning
is that holding SHIFT while selecting adds to the selection!! and
holding CTRL while dragging a selection box removes from the selection,
Check you have the right faces/verts selected by checking the 3D
Preview in wireframe mode.<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm13.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE HEAD - SPHERICAL MAPPING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NOW its gets tough
:) I usually have to exoeriment with getting the head mapping right and
its probably a better idea to break it down into smaller goups, like
face, top head, back and sides, neck, ear, this makes it easier to map
each area but for now in Stage 1, I applied SPHERICAL mapping, with
axis alignment "Y" (I had to try the others until this one worked its a
bit of guesswork) also Space Poles ticked and I applied it. Stage 2,
the two vertical edges I have marked are where the front seam of the
face joins, I found out by sleecteing some faces as shown and seeing
what shows up in the 3D view! Now, I would prefer the center seem to be
in the middle so it makes painting the face more natural, so in the
next step I am going to select the left half of the face and move it
over to the right so the two seems are touching, that way the other
seam will be on the back (less noticeable)<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm14.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DA BUTTONS...</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you can see here
I have selected the left half of the head, moved it so that is was on
the right and lined up the seems (zooming in to be accurate) and now
you can see the head mapped and you can almost make out the facial
features in the centre!!! I thought I'd mention the little buttons up
the top as well just to explain about them.<br><br>
1. The select and move button, Also by Pressing "S" you can scale the
selection by dragging the corner boxes. You should be in this mode most
of the time.<br><br>
2. The Move View button, use this to pan around your view, especially when zoomed in.<br><br>
3. The Zoom button, click and drag to zoom in or out of your view.<br><br>
4. The Zoom Area button, drag a box around the area you want to zoom into.<br><br>
5. The Vertex Mode button, using this allows you to manipulate the
vertexs (always drag a box around each vertex as there are usually two
or more on top of each other) YOU cannot ASSIGN A MATERIAL when this
button is pressed.<br><br>
6. The Faces Mode button, this allows you to select and move faces,
also SHIFT adds to the selection and CTRL removes from your selection,
same applies to the other modes. you can ASSIGN MATERIALS TO SELECTED
FACES<br><br>
7. The Group Mode button, this allows you to select whole groups! you can ASSIGN MATERIALS TO SELECTED GROUPS (I think :))

</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOX MAPPING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the feet I
applied Box Mapping, seperated and spaced as shown, then I selct parts
and see whatthey apply to in the 3D view as shown. Box Mapping is
basically planar from the front,back top,bottom and two sides, and you
could probably map the head or other parts using it fell free to
experiment :) I will move bits that are the same over the top of each
other flipping them vertically/horizonatally or rotating if needed. I
want each foot to receive the same mapping on this model so thats why
they will be over the top of each other I will show you the layout in
the next pic.<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm16.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE FOOT LAYOUT</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After laying each
piece over its equal, I began to lay them out, always watching the 3d
view. We now have the Side view, the sole underneath, the top and front
above and the back of the ankle to the right, I moved them all into
position and scaled them to fite nice and neatly to save space, this
also helps when laying out all the pieces later on. Again, Box mapping
can be used for many areas!<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm17.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE LEGS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I applied Decal
Mapping to the front of the trouser group and as you can see the area
marked "A" is streching because the faces are side on to the
projection. To fix it I selected the vertexs watching carefully in the
3D view (using wireframe flat mode) that they were the correct ones and
as you can see on the area marked red on the left I have pulled the
vertexs out to the left showing the faces that were previously at 90
degrees to the projection. When you look from the other side of the
model the outer leg is fixed as you will see in a later screenshot.<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm18.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CYLINDRICAL MAPPING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the stump of
bone sticking out of the zombies' broken arm I applied cylindrical
mapping. The faces Marked "1" are the faces around the sides of the
protruding bone and the faces marked "2" make up the cap on the end of
the bone. Also useful for arms and legs sometimes and even faces, it
all depends and you have to experiment to find out which AXIS' works, I
never get it right first time :)<br><br><br>



<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm19.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BOX MAPPING THE ARM</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I sometimes use
Cylindrical mapping on arms/legs etc but not this time. I only really
discovered this method while writing this tutorial :) I applied box
mapping to the arm and it gave me four sides and the top of the
shoulder, so I selected a strip and checked which one it was in the 3D
view (Wireframe Flat mode again) then I selected the faces which were
next to it in the 3D view, moved them alongside and moved the vertexs
to overlap the ones along the other edge. I did the same for the
others, so we end up with the round, cylindrical arm layed out flat.
the faces marked "1" are the inside of the arm faces I havent moved the
vertexs to match the the faces to the right of it yet, just thought It
would illustrate my point. The area marked "2" is the faces on top of
the shoulder, I will move the that in as well later so the correct
vertexs are overlapping!<br><br><br>

<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm20.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ALL DONE...NEARLY</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have Decal mapped
the back of the trousers, Box Mapped the hand and thats it!!! Check out
the pic to see that the checks cover the whole model, I also changed it
from 8x8 tiling to 16x16 just to give a little more detail on the
checking.<br><br><br>

<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm21.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UNHIDE AND THE MESS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you go to
Edit&gt;Unhide All it shows you all your groups on screen at the same
time, usually its even messier than this :) but I scaled stuff down a
bit as I went along, you must go through each group (Change selection
to group mode) and scale them all down (press "S" to scale) so they
roughly fit on the square. Now its time to see which bits are important
like the head, etc and make them larger, moving groups around and
scaling them to fit as efficiently as possible. I cannot explain this
part its just experimentation.<br><br><br>

<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm22.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EXPORTING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you have layed
all the groups out as best you can goto File&gt;UV Map&gt;Save to save
the UV template ready for painting over, as you can see above I have
chosen a 512x512 skin for this one and filled lines to mark the groups
faces!<br><br><br>

<img src="mapeando%20textura%20uv_files/zuvm23.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE TEMPLATE</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Heres the exported
template, now when you paint over this and Apply it to the model in
Milkshape or in Lithunwrap if you like you should see your details
mapped onto your model. The next tutorial will cover some basic 2d
painting techiniques. Hope you found this useful cus it took bloody
ages to write :)<br><br><br>
