</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SCAN IN YOUR DRAWING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I usually draw a
very rough front and side view keeping them in line with each other,
then I scan them in, resize to about 500 pixels high, darken the image
so that white vertices and lines show up when working over the top in
milkshape. I crop them and save them as Front.jpg and Side.jpg then in
milkshape, right click in the front view to bring up the menu, and
"Choose background image" using Front.jpg and do the same for the side
view (using Side.jpg), you can see what I mean the following pics.....<br><br><br>


<img src="modelando_files/zmod02.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">START ADDING VERTS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I usually start by
creating a load of verts in a strip up the front of the chest, I move
them all one by one into position, in the front and side views,then I
create faces to join the dots, Check out my other milkshape basics
tutorials if you dont know how to do this. As you can see the faces are
quite flat across the front of the torso...<br><br><br>


<img src="modelando_files/zmod03.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MORE VERTS AND FACES</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I now add another
row of verts and create the faces, I move the verts into position and
constantly check how it looks in the 3D view, Mostly in FLAT shaded
mode, if you get any faces facing the wrong way you can reverse them as
you go along. Its also a good idea NOT to have a black background, that
way you can see if any faces are facing inwards etc.<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod04.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THINK ABOUT STUFF</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Building more faces
by adding a few verts at a time and creating faces, I also think about
where the shoulder will be extruded from, so I build faces (as shown
selected) so that I can later extrude the shoulder/arm etc from it.
Sometimes you need to plan ahead :)<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod05.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE BACK</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I keep adding verts
in the side view and building faces, I then move all the verts into
position to follow the shape of the back and also down the center line,
so that when the model is mirrored the front edge and back edge can be
welded.<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod06.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EXTRUDING THE LEG</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I add verts and
create the top of the leg building faces (you need some faces there to
extrude from), making sure they are facing downwards by looking from
below in the 3D view, then I select all the faces, CLICK extrude and in
the front view drag em downwards creating the thigh.<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod07.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SELECTING END FACES</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now lets just say I
lost my selection and wanted to select the end faces to extrude the
next segments of the leg? Ok, we drag a box and select all the faces we
want plus all the others we dont really need, but need to make sure we
get all the faces on the end of the thigh. Check the next step.....<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod08.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SELECTING END FACES 2</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now drag a box as
shown while HOLDING SHIFT and the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON, this will remove
unwanted faces from your selection leaving only the end faces selected
ready for extruding the next segments of the leg. SHIFT and LEFT CLICK
adds to whatever is selected and SHIFT and RIGHT CLICK removes from the
selection.<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod09.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MORE EXTRUDING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I extruded down a
few more times scaling it in front and side views to match my reference
images and as you can see here I need a step where his torn trousers
will end so I extrude a small amount then scale it in from front and
side to match the size of the leg..<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod10.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">EVEN MORE EXTRUDING....</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I Extruded again and
scaled it to the size of the ankle in the front and side views and
moved it into position slightly, I did the same for the foot. When
scaling you get three options, Center of Mass, Origin and User Point.
Select "User Point" that way whatever is selected scales relative to
where your cursor is, try it to see what I mean :) Very very useful<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod11.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TESTING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I went to
Edit-Duplicate selection then Vertex Mirror Left-&gt;Right to get a
mirrored copy, I moved it across so the center lines were overlapping.
Now its time have a real good look over it in the 3D view and turn any
edges or tweak verts that aint quite right. Actually I do this many
times as I'm modelling just to keep an eye on things! I then Deleted
the duplicate and carried on working on just one side.<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod12.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE ARM</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Select the faces
that we purposely created in the shape of the shoulder and extrude out
horizontally once to create the shoulder, move the verts to follow the
shape of the sjoulder in the reference image, Now deselect and eslect
the faces that are facing downwards, extrude the arm downwards scaling
as you go along following the reference images again. Some faces dont
quite look right sometimes so you need to select two faces and use CTRL
E or turn edge, please read my milkshape basics for more on this but
after a while you'll know which faces need turning (after about your
tenth model :))<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod13.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE HAND</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I extruded the arm
down and carried on to form the basic shape of the hand, I needed some
extra faces to extrude the thumb from so I used "Subdivide 4" this
divides the selected faces, and it was a BAD IDEA!!!!!! It left me with
vertexs in between others etc, I had to search em out and snap and weld
them to other existing verts, took me a while, so my TIP is plan ahead
like I mentioned earlier, I should have extruded just one more time and
I would have had the faces I needed to extrude the thumb But this is
how I learn, the hard way :).<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod14.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TESTING AGAIN</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I duplicated and
mirrored again to see how things where looking, put it in Smooth shade
mode, looked over it tweaked things, put it in Wireframe mode and
looked over it tweaked things, put it in Flat mode and looked over it
tweaked things from all angles. when I say tweaked I mean moved vertexs
into better positions, turning edges that dont look right and generally
making sure it looks OK from all angles. Then its time for the head!!
Delete the duplicate and make a start on the head......<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod15.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE FACE</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now for the fun
part!!! I add some verts basically forming the flat-ish front of the
face, I move them into position using the side view as well to follow
the lines of the face, then I build the faces. Basically just like
building the torso, add a strip of verts, move em into position and
build the faces. As you can see I place verts where changes in the
faces that make up THE FACE will occur...Get what I mean? :)<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod16.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE HEAD AND EAR</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now I started adding
some verts to the side of the head and moving them into position using
the front view, As you can see I built faces for where I intend to
extrude the ear from later (Selected in RED) Other than that its a case
of adding verts, building faces and constantly checking in the 3D view
(FLAT shade mode) if any edges need turning.<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod17.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE EAR</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I added more verts
and built faces for the back of the head. I then Selected the faces for
the ear and extruded it out once, I dragged a box around the two verts
marked "1"selecting them then I Snap 'N' Welded em using CTLR N and
CTLR W, I did the same for the two verts marked "2" This brings the
front edges of the ear in flush with the head instead of sticking out
like a block (see the picture after the next one)<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod18.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SELECTING THE CENTER VERTS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I am satisfied with
it now So I duplicate and mirror and move the duplicate so that its
center line is touching the the originals center line. I select ALL and
Regroup them into one mesh in the groups tab. Then from the TOP view I
dragged a thin box over all the center verts selecting them, then I
used CTRL I to invert the selection and CTRL H to hide the selection,
this leaves me with just the center verts visible. Even though it only
looks like theres one vertex at each point there is two, one from each
half of the model, so in the next step we will weld them together to
get rid of the seem.<br><br><br>



<img src="modelando_files/zmod19.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SNAP AND WELD THE SEEM</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I start by selecting
the verts on the chin for example (So I remember where I started from)
I use the side view and drag a small selection box around the vertex
(well two verts really) in the chin, I use CTLR N and CTLR W to snap
and weld, then I select the vert under the nose and Snap and weld and
so on and son on, all the way around the center line and if you set the
3D view to Smooth shading you can see the seem being closed as you go
along. Thats it really, easy wasn't it? The next tutorial will be about
grouping and UV mapping using Lithunwrap!! Hope you found this useful.<br><br><br>
