</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SELECTING THE GROUPS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OK, I exported the
UV map and opened it up in Photoshop, 1. I created a new layer by
clicking the blank page on the bottom of the layer TAB. 2. Then using
the Polygon Selection tool, I went around the front of the shirt, then
whilst holding SHIFT I also selected around the back of the shirt, Now
using the Paint Bucket/Fill tool I filled it in solid 100% in a kind of
off-white colour, as you can see in the next step.<br><br><br>


<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin02.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LAYERS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I did the same for
each group that I wanted to keep seperate, So I have The Trousers
filled on a layer, the Stump filled on a layer, all the skin filled on
a layer and the shirt filled on a layer. This allows easy selection of
each group by holding CTRL and left clicking in the area marked red in
the layers TAB, your trousers will be magically selected :) These
solids will form the basic colour tones of the model and all details
will be painted on layes above each one allowing easy modifications...<br><br><br>


<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin03.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ASSIGNING THE SKIN</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">OK, now open up
Milkshape and keep it open at the same time as Photoshop. Click the
materials TAB and CLICK NEW (I forgot to mark it :)) anyway create a
new material then 1. click the top material button marked 1, and choose
zombie.jpg (which is a flattened saved version of the photoshop file)
then 2. Click EMISSIVE and move it up from solid black to a dark grey,
this lightens the shading on the model and brightens the colours. then
SELECT ALL THE FACES (not vertexs as shown in the pic heh heh) and
click the ASSIGN button. Right click the 3d window and select Textured
view and there it is, tha basic colours.<br><br><br>



<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin04.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE STUMP</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I created a new
layer above the STUMP layer and CTRL clicked the STUMP layer to get my
selection, then using the airbrush at various opacities, colours and
sizes I added some details on the layer above, again this allows me to
delete/adjust stuff without affecting the main solid colour layers.<br><br><br>



<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin05.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SKIN DETAILS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I created a new
layer above the SKIN layer to paint the details onto, but first I
lowered the LAYER OPACITY of the SKIN layer to about 96% this allows me
to see the UV mesh underneath, giving me a guide to follow when
painting stuff. Back to the Skin detials layer above and I start
airbrushing in some very rough details, just blobs of a darker colour
really, I constantly save the image and flick to Milkshape and Re-open
up the image file to update it. As you can see at this point I'm just
finding out where the forms of the face are<br><br><br>



<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin06.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MORE NASTY DETAILS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After putting in
some blobs and finding out roughly where the eyes were etc, I zoomed in
and started to paint some details using low opacity airbrush and
various small brush sizes. I painted some dark areas around the eyes
then painted the solid white eyeballs over the top, and using darker
shades of the skin colour (use ALT (eyedropper) while on the airbrush
to quickly pick colours from within your pic) I also found a site the
other day in preparation for this all about skin disorders...hmmm nice
and I saved off some nasty pics for reference, I roughed in some holes
and gashes getting ideas from the pics.<br><br><br>



<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin07.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CHECK IT OUT</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All the time I'm
painting I constantly flatten and save (or save for web) and re-open up
the skin in Milkshape to see how things are going. If you have the new
UNWRAP 3D you can leave the 3D window open over photoshop and it auto
updates each time you save the skin, but I prefer how things look in
milkshape for the time being. I also added a bit of craqelure to the
skin to give it a leathery look...<br><br><br>



<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin08.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PAINTING THE TROUSERS</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I added some
monochromatic noise to the TROUSER layer just to give em a bit of
texture. Then I created (guess what?) another layer above the TROUSER
layer to paint the details on. I picked a lighter blue colour and
lightly airbrushed some subtle highlights onto the detail layer, then
Using a slightly darker blue I added some shadows, creases and general
blobs :) <br><br><br>



<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin09.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE SKIN</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This tutorial is not
meant to teach anybody how to paint or anything its just to give you
guys an idea of how I do things I suppose. Anyway, I added some dirt
and grime and a bit of shading on a layer above the SHIRT layer and I
also spent a couple of hours tweaking and changing all the other bits
until they looked right on the model.<br><br><br>



<img src="texturando%20o%20zumbi_files/zskin10.jpg" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE ZOMBIE</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are a few
screengrabs from 3D explorer but its lights tend to make definate
lines, but it looks fine in Milkshape etc, but I kinda like the
lighting in it. As you can see the textures are finished and the
mapping works OK, phew!!!! OK I hope you guys found this useful somehow
:) The next tutorial will probably be in a few parts dealing with
CHARACTER FX and creating a skeleton, assigning the vertexs, then how
to do a simple walk cycle, so look out for that soon-ish....<br><br><br>
