<center>LOAD THE MODEL</center>
I exported the zombie from milkshape as a MILKSHAPE ASCII.TXT file,
ready to be imported into CFX. Then click Windows and choose Material
editor, you should see a window popup like in the pic below......
<br><br><br>


<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones02.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>ASSIGNING THE SKIN</center>1. click the Select tool and select
the Zombie Mesh, 2. Click Open New Texture and find the zombie.jpg
skin, and it'll show up in the Material editor window as shown, you can
open several for multi texturing, anyway 3. Click the Assign Texture to
assign mesh as shown, and your texture will show up on the model.<br><br><br>


<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones03.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>CREATING THE CENTRAL BONES</center>
OK, Now this method is just my method at the moment, its not the best
and I will change it to suit various models but for something simple
like this, it'll do :) Click the BONES button on the top bar as shown
marked in red and click in the front view to create BONE 1 at the base,
then bone 2,bone 3 etc... THE bone 1 is so I can rotate the whole
zombie and also its good reference for where the floor is.<br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones04.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>ADDING THE LEG BONES</center>
Now to create the leg bones, I select the SELECT tool and click the
bone marked in red, this is where the leg bones will start as you can
see in the next pic.<br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones05.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>LEG BONES</center>
Now click the BONES button again as marked in red, and click 1,2 and 3
to create the leg bones. Now remember to CLICK select again to select
the centre bone again, click the Bones button and create the leg bones
on the other side. You must select a bone that NEW bones will be joined
to(well you dont have to but in this case you do :)) <br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones06.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>SKELETON</center>
I created bones for the arms etc and in the side view I (clicked of
Meshes as marked in red so only joints can be selected) moved the bones
to match the mesh. make sure you tick meshes again after moving all the
bones in the front/side views into the correct positions. Also worth a
mention is (as marked in the top left) I change the coords to Local
from World so things rotate about themselves etc.<br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones07.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>BIND THE SKIN</center>
Now this is the time consuming part and its difficult to explain but
I'll do my best with a few examples. First the easy bit click
Skeleton&gt;Bind Skin in the menu and your mesh will be attached to the
bones. Now click the button marked red, to edit vertex assignments, and
also right click it to bring up the options window as shown. Now when I
clicked the head bone it showed me which verts were assigned but the
ones marked red were assigned to a lower bone for some reason, anyway I
selected that bone selected the verts I wanted UNASSIGNED and
unassigned them, I then clicked the head bone again and clicked SELECT
UNASSIGNED, this gave me the ones on the top of the head, I then
ASSIGNED them and all the verts in the head are assigned to the head
bone. Now if you go into Animation mode, you can rotate the head bone
and the head will move (DONT FORGET TO UNDO AFTER TESTING IT)<br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones08.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>THE STUMP</center>
As you can see in this pic the Elbow Bone has all the verts in the
lower arm ASSIGNED to it, so this is OK, When we rotate the joint the
whole forearm will move.<br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones09.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>THE SHOULDER</center>
When I selected the Shoulder bone I could see that several verts in the
body were also assigned to it, this means when the shoulder moves so
will these verts creating weird stuff to happen in the body :) Check
the next stage to see how to fix it<br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones10.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>UNASSIGNING</center>
I selected the bone and also seleted the verts that I wanted
UNASSIGNED, using CTRL to add to the selection and ALT to remove from
the selection, now I have them selected click UNASSIGN.<br><br><br>


<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones11.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>ASSIGNING</center>
1. I selected the spine bone which I want to assign those verts to
instead of the shoulder, 2. click SELECT UNASSIGNED to select those
LOOSE verts and 3. I ASSIGNED em to the spine bone instead. Basically
the idea is to check each bone and make sure the correct verts are
assigned to it, so it moves correctly, I constantly check in animation
mode how things look by rotating something then UNDO-ing after seeing
how its affected.<br><br><br>



<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones12.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>LEG</center>
I selected the leg and as you can see ALL the lower leg verts are
assigned to it, but I want the foot verts assigned to the ankle bone so
I can rotate the foot seperately.<br><br><br>


<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones13.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>UNASSIGNING</center>
I selected the knee bone and the verts in the foot (I unchecked joints
so only verts can be selected for the moment) and UNASSIGN by dragging
a selection box around the feet verts..<br><br><br>


<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones14.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>FOOT ASSIGN</center>
Now I select the ankle/Foot bone and 1. SELECT UNASSIGNED then 2. click
ASSIGN to assign the foot verts to the foot bone, test it in Animation
Mode by rotating and UNDO-ing :)<br><br><br>


<img src="ossando%20o%20zumbi_files/zbones15.gif" border="0"><br>
<center>ZOMBIE DANCING</center>
I keep going through each joint and testing things in animation mode
then Switching back to OBJECT mode and Unassigning/assigning verts
until it all works right, and as you can see above the Zombie is trying
open a door with his Stumpy hand or having a bit of a dance :) OK, I
seperated this tutorial from the actual animation one cus I thought
there was too much for one tutorial, the Walk cycle tutorial is next so
look out for it very soon. Hope you found this useful!<br><br><br>
