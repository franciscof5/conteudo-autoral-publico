</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ADD SOME FRAMES</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. I Clicked the box
marked red and typed 21 to give me 21 frames of animation, I'll add
more later. 2. This area is the PLAY/LOOP RANGE markers, by pulling the
arrows on either end you can designate which range of frames will play
when you press the play button.<br><br><br>


<img src="animando%20os%20ossos_files/zanim02.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NEUTRAL FRAMES</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I moved in the LOOP
MARKERS to play frames 2-20, while on frame 1 I pressed the BIG KEY
with a PLUS underneath up top, to add keyframes, I then toggled copy as
marked in red, dragged a selection box around all the frame one keys
and copied em to frame 2 and frame 21, this is just the standard
neutral pose, I like to put them either side of each anim, then I have
a basic pose to for when I want to add more animations! <br><br><br>


<img src="animando%20os%20ossos_files/zanim03.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POSE 1</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FIRST I switched on
AUTOKEYFRAMING as shown then moved the slider so the focus is on Frame
2. Then using the ROTATE tool to pose him, arms rotated opposite to the
legs. Then I copied frame 2 to Frame 20 to make each end of the anim,
in the middle I will move the arms/legs opposite and they'll move back
and forth.<br><br><br>



<img src="animando%20os%20ossos_files/zanim04.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">POSE 2</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I moved the slider
to frame 11 (center of the frames) and rotated his arms and legs into
the same position as POSE 1 but opposite, ie leg that was forward is
now backward, etc. Press play and he walks, needs lots of tweaking but
its a start :-)<br><br><br>



<img src="animando%20os%20ossos_files/zanim05.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">TWEAKING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Two Frames (although
I moved it to 3 later) after the back leg starts moving forward, I
rotated at the knee to lift up the foot, this bends the leg as it
swings forward. I did the same for the other leg on frame 14 so that
also bends after it starts to swing forward. I figured this out by
walking around and thinking/watching about how I/others walked :-)<br><br><br>



<img src="animando%20os%20ossos_files/zanim06.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">MORE TWEAKING</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you can see the
foot goes through the floor, so I find a frame where its doing so and
rotate the leg etc to make sure its on the surface. Also I make the
body move up and down slightly with each step and rotate the shoulders
and hips slightly. I also twist the head a little, its basically lots
of subtle movements now and AUTOKEYFRAMING sets keys anytime I move a
joint, I just have to watch what Frame I'm on!!!!!!<br><br><br>



<img src="animando%20os%20ossos_files/zanim07.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">LOOP</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have set the range
to 2-19 so I dont include the final frame which is the same as the
first and is therefore getting played twice and you'll notice a pause
in the anim. This not exactly in-depth I know but its a difficult
subject :-) Final advice would be to observe people, and get animating,
after your first few tries you'll get the hang of it!!! Good Luck!<br><br><br>



<img src="animando%20os%20ossos_files/zanim08.gif" border="0"><br>
</font><center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Anim</font></center>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As you can see after
his legs go back they bend before swinging forward. His arm also does
something similar, after swinging fully forward, I bent it forward a
little about three frames after. His head and shoulders slightly turn
opposite to each other and the main body goes up and down slightly.
Hope you found this useful somehow!!!!
