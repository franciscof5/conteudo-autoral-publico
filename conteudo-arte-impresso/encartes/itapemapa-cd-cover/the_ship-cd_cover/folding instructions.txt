Folding instructions:

How to fold the paper case: 

1. Fold the left and right sides following the front cover line.
2. Fold the bottom edge up following the front cover line . Then fold it back. This part will be the pocket.
3. Fold the top edge down, keep following the line of the front cover and then fold it back. This will make the spine and top flap.
4. Spread the sides of the pocket to the sides to create "wings". Follow the lines
5. Tuck the wings behind the front part of the pocket. The two letter "A"s should touch each other and the two letter "B"s should touch each other. Flatten the pocket. Your CD will go in the pocket.
6. Make little dog ears in the top flap following the drawing.
7. Tuck the top flap into the pocket. You're done!
